I studied Geology at EAFIT University in Colombia, where I became fascinated by how Earth systems work and how natural hazards affect communities. That interest led me to the University of British Columbia for a Master’s in Geological Sciences, where I focused on landslides and geospatial data analysis. During that time, I began combining GIS, programming, and statistics to build models predicting landslide susceptibility, and discovered I was especially drawn to the analytical side of climate and hazard research.

Now, as a Ph.D. candidate in Geography at UC Santa Barbara specializing in Climate Science and Climate Change, my research focuses on post-fire debris flows in California and the rainfall conditions that trigger them. I work with datasets ranging from rain gauges and radar to reanalysis and  climate projections, generating insights that support hazard monitoring and early warning in a changing climate.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing tennis, watching (almost any) series, and never saying no to ice cream or a good croissant.
