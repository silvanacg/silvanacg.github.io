# About

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Geography focused on understanding hydroclimate hazards. Experienced in integrating large datasets (satellite imagery, radar reflectivity, rain gauge observations, reanalysis products, and climate projections) to develop and validate statistical models (e.g., Random Forest) for hazard susceptibility and probability assessment. Skilled in translating complex climate data into actionable insights that support resilience planning and decision-making for risk assessments.
