Agricultural productivity in tropical regions is highly sensitive to heat stress in livestock. This project evaluated how projected climate warming may affect milk production and economic losses across Colombia.

---

#### Data
- CORDEX regional climate projections (temperature and relative humidity; historical 1970–2006, future 2030–2100)
- National agricultural census livestock inventory (DANE)
- Historical milk price records

#### Methods
To quantify heat stress on dairy cattle, I calculated the **Temperature–Humidity Index (THI)** using NOAA (1976):

THI = (1.8 × T + 32) − (0.55 − 0.55 × RH) × (1.8 × T − 26)

Milk production losses were estimated using the St-Pierre et al. (2003) empirical model:

MilkLoss = 0.0695 × (THImax − THIthreshold)² × D

where *D* represents the fraction of the day exceeding the heat-stress threshold.

Economic losses were then calculated using projected milk production reductions and regional milk prices.

#### Results
- Future climate scenarios show widespread increases in heat stress conditions
- Significant reductions in daily milk production across warm regions
- Substantial projected economic losses to the dairy sector
