### Climate Change Impacts on Dairy Production in Colombia

Agricultural productivity in tropical regions is highly sensitive to heat stress in livestock. This project evaluated how projected climate warming may affect milk production and economic losses across Colombia.

#### Data
- CORDEX regional climate projections (temperature and relative humidity; historical 1970–2006, future 2030–2100)
- National agricultural census livestock inventory (DANE)
- Historical milk price records

#### Methods
To quantify heat stress on dairy cattle, I calculated the **Temperature–Humidity Index (THI)** using NOAA (1976):

THI = (1.8 × T + 32) − (0.55 − 0.55 × RH) × (1.8 × T − 26)

Milk production losses were estimated using the St-Pierre et al. (2003) empirical model:

MilkLoss = 0.0695 × (THImax − THIthreshold)² × D

where *D* represents the fraction of the day exceeding the heat-stress threshold.

Economic losses were then calculated using projected milk production reductions and regional milk prices.

#### Results
- Future climate scenarios show widespread increases in heat stress conditions
- Significant reductions in daily milk production across warm regions
- Substantial projected economic losses to the dairy sector
