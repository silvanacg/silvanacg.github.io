title: "Post-Fire Debris Flows Under a Changing Climate"

## Overview
Post-fire debris flows occur when intense rainfall follows wildfire before soils and vegetation recover.  
This project evaluates how climate change may alter that sequence by analyzing the future co-occurrence of extreme fire weather and debris-flow-triggering rainfall across California.

---

## Research Question
Under climate change conditions, does the occurence of wildfire conditions followed by hazardous rainfall capable of generating debris flows increases?

---

## Data
- MACA and 15-min rainfall climate projections (historical and late-century scenarios)
- Fire Weather Index (FWI) derived from temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation
- Short-duration rainfall simulations capturing debris-flow-triggering intensities
- Mountain terrain mask in California
---

## Method
1. Computed extreme fire-weather events (perecentile 99.9) using the Fire Weather Index
2. Modify NOAA 14- 1yr Return Interval Rainfall thresholds associated with debris-flow initiation to match rainfall projections 
3. Evaluated how often rainfall follows wildfire conditions within 3-, 6-, and 12-month windows
4. Compared historical vs future climate scenarios

## Key Findings (So far..)

### Earlier seasonal alignment
Fire and rainfall seasons move closer together, reducing post-fire recovery time.

### Transition from rare to common events
Many regions shift from occasional compound events to recurring occurrences by late century.
