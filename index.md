Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Geography focused on understanding hydroclimate hazards. I integrate large datasets (satellite imagery, radar reflectivity, rain gauge observations, reanalysis products, and climate projections) to develop and validate statistical models (e.g., Random Forest) for hazard susceptibility and probability assessment. I aim to translate complex climate data into actionable insights that support resilience planning and decision-making for risk assessments.
